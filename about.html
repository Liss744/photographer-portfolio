        <p>I'm Lisa Duarte — a photographer with a deep love for light, emotion, and real moments. My work is about more than capturing a scene; it’s about witnessing connection and telling stories with honesty and beauty.</p>
        <p>I started my journey with a film camera in hand and a curiosity for people. Over the years, I’ve developed a style that’s soft, intimate, and emotionally grounded. Whether I’m shooting a wedding, a quiet portrait, or a nature series, my goal is always the same: to reflect the raw, honest essence of what I see.</p>
        <p>If you’re someone who values meaning over perfection and moments over poses, we’ll get along just fine.</p>
        <p class="about-quote">“Photography, for me, is a form of care.”</p>
